I did all of my changes on a separate CSS file. I did not do any inline css or internal. The easiest part was adjusting the font size and types of the headers. The issues I came accross were trying to get the ordered and unordered lists to be spaced. I figured out that I had to make them in a selector and refer them to a margin-top adjustment. I also had an issue with spacing the input boxes in the octopus quiz but I found the proper selector in w3 schools and just spaces it accordingly. The common octopus box was fine to adjust I just ended up creating a lot or maybe too many selectors for each feature. I had an issue with spacing the words inside their boxes but figured it sort of was the same way as the lists from above. I would say the best way I got over these issues was just trial and error.
